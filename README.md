# DECO
DECO is a citizen science project that enables users around the world to detect cosmic rays and other energetic particles with their cell phones and tablets. Cosmic rays are energetic subatomic particles produced by powerful cosmic accelerators, such as black holes and exploding stars. When a cosmic-ray muon hits the camera sensor, it liberates some electrons. The accumulated charge tells us about the amount of energy particle deposited, while the distribution of this charge in our sensor, the shape, tells us about the kind of particle that has produced it.

DECO detects three distinct types of particle physics events: tracks, worms, and spots
